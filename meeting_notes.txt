    talking points
        transfer of leadership from Dan Roberts and Chris Cole to Chris Wendt (Dan Roberts and Chris Cole graduated 2013.05)
        SIGART should be a flat club in terms of hierarchy
        Chris Wendt will be performing tasks needed by SIGART as a whole
            setting up Git repositories
            attending the weekly ACM meeetings
            providing overall club guidance
            sending update emails
        project ideas
            Robocode
                initially build Robocode robots to try to beat stock robots and battle each other's robots
            document reconstruction
                shuffle pieces around and use edge detection to measure error
                ultimate goal is to take a picture of shredded document and reconstruct it
        SIGART repository and projects are on Github
        balance fun, learning, and discussions

2013.09.07
    introduced newcomers to SIGART, past projects, and plans
    added people to mailing list
    ACM news: CS department is paying SIGs to populate tech talks this semester
    Isilon tech talk Sep 12 @12pm LWSN 3102
    set up Robocode development environments using robocode_setup.md
    sent out whenisgood for good meeting times
    sent out link to Github repository
    sent out article/concept to discuss next week

2013.09.14
    announced upcoming events: Microsoft Puzzle Quest, Career Fair, VMware tech talk, Yelp tech talk
    mentioned that ACM is asking for members' names, emails, and resumes to sell to Corporate Partners
    mentioned that the CS department is paying ACM groups to populate tech talks
    discussed Chinese Room thought experiment
    asked for topic suggestions
    began a Robocode robot based on genetic programming
    
2013.09.21
    announced upcoming company days in ACM
    discussed AGI (Artificial General Intelligence), malevolent AI, and self-aware robots
    wrote some basic genetic programming functionality in GeneticBot, predicated firing based on an equation
    began the document reconstruction project, set up Github repository
    added users to both Github repositories

2013.09.28
    showed members various common image processing techniques such as thresholding and edge detection for use in our document reconstruction project
    announced upcoming ACM events for next week
    worked on document reconstruction: able to load and display an image in a window, decided on an image processing pipeline, and split up research tasks

2013.10.05
    discussed some image processing techniques
    split into two groups for blob detection and background removal
    blob detection was partially implemented
    the background removal group determined frequencies of colors in the original image

2013.10.12
    jumped straight into the document reconstruction project
    blob detection logic was fixed
    individual strips of paper are now put into separate images
    came up with technique (background subtraction) to reduce the background's affect on the silhouettes of strips
    documented background subtraction and added a diagram of the technique to the repository

2013.10.19
    introduced members to videos by Jeff Hawkins, along with his book On Intelligence
    split up the background subtraction algorithm into tasks
    modified the UI framework to support a step-by-step pipeline

2013.10.26
    implemented background subtraction algorithm
    discussed ways to put individual pieces of paper together
    figured out how to draw translated and rotated images

2013.11.02
    wrote an edge detection image filter
    wrote an image summing function
    added a small blob removal step
    created a step and framework for a shuffling solver
